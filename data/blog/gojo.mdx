### Hackathon Project Report

## Executive Summary

In September 2025, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Education announced the rollout of a new national curriculum. While promising, it places pressure on educators who are already burdened by time constraints, resource scarcity, and a significant digital divide. Gojo is meant as a reprieve to this challenge. Gojo is a web/mobile AI-powered assistant designed to drastically reduce planning time, improve the quality of teaching materials, and bridge linguistic and resource gaps for teachers across the nation. It automates the creation of curriculum-aligned, grade-appropriate, and contextually relevant weekly lesson plans.

Key features include **multilingual translation** into Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo; **offline export** to PDF; and a unique **syllabus customization** feature that empowers teachers to validate and tailor the AI's output to their specific classroom needs. Gojo aims to be a reliable partner for every Nigerian teacher, aiming to save 3-4 hours per week per teacher and directly contributing to improved teaching quality and student outcomes.

## 1. The Problem: An Educational System in Transition

![group-african-kids.jpg](/static/images/group-african-kids.jpg)

Africa, and particularly Nigeria, recognises the issues in education that impact its long-term growth. The launch of a new national curriculum by the Federal Ministry of Education signals the intention of the authorities in preparing students for a 21st-century workforce, emphasizing practical and vocational skills. However, the success of this reform hinges on the teachers tasked with its implementation. Research and on-the-ground realities reveal several challenges that threaten this transition:

* **Intense Time Pressure and Workload:** Nigerian teachers are often overworked, managing large class sizes and numerous subjects. The pupil-to-teacher ratio in many public primary schools is about **40:1** [7], which is above national policy recommendations and much higher than in many states’ target ratios.
    There is also a large shortage of **qualified teachers**: only about **70.8%** of basic education teachers meet required qualifications; thus nearly one in three teachers is unqualified [2].
    * In public primary schools, the country needs an additional **194,876** qualified teachers to meet existing requirements [3].

* **Resource and Quality Gaps:** Access to high-quality teaching materials that are aligned with the new curriculum is inconsistent, especially in rural and underserved areas. Many teachers lack access to textbooks and other essential aids. For example, only about **54.8%** of schools had the minimum teaching materials, and only about **38.2%** of pupils had access to a mathematics or English textbook in surveyed areas [4].

* **The Digital and Linguistic Divide:** While urban educators may have better connectivity, many rural teachers face limited internet connectivity and lower digital literacy. Nigeria is extremely linguistically diverse: the country is home to **over 500 indigenous languages**. Although English is the official medium of instruction, using local languages (especially Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo) in early education has been shown to improve comprehension and engagement [5].

* **Resistance to Change and Lack of Support:** Introducing a new curriculum requires extensive retraining and continuous support. The new curriculum (launched September 2025) includes subjects like digital literacy, entrepreneurship, coding, robotics, etc., which many teachers are not yet fully equipped to teach [8].

Gojo is built to address these problems, providing a support system that empowers teachers to implement the new curriculum to full effect.

Gojo is an AI-powered web (and in the future, mobile) platform designed to be the Nigerian teacher's most reliable assistant.

Our target users are represented by three key personas from our Product Requirements Document (PRD):
- **Mrs. Amina Ibrahim:** A primary school teacher in rural Kano with low tech literacy, who needs curriculum content in Hausa.
- **Mr. Chukwudi Okafor:** A busy JSS teacher in urban Lagos who needs to automate planning to maintain quality across multiple classes.
- **Miss Fatima Yusuf:** A new SSS teacher in semi-urban Kaduna who needs guidance and practical examples for teaching new vocational subjects.

By acknowledging these diverse needs, Gojo ensures its features are practical, inclusive, and impactful.
The full PRD document can be viewed here in the Appendix section.

## 3. Core Features and Hackathon Alignment

Each feature is mapped to a specific teacher need and a hackathon deliverable.

### Automated & Customized Lesson Plan Generation
{/* <VideoEmbed src="./media/lesson-gen-snippet.mp4" title="Lesson Plan Generation Demo" /> */}



<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hNMnCufrpCKdvG6g0nwr-o0LvFjT9FEL/preview" 
  title="video player"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
>
</iframe>


* **What it does:** Based on a teacher's grade, subject, and weekly schedule, Gojo's AI automatically generates a complete lesson plan 24 hours before class. There is a **Syllabus Review** feature, where teachers first review and edit an AI-generated syllabus for the term, ensuring all future lesson plans align perfectly with their validated weekly topics.
* **How it helps:** This eliminates the most time-consuming part of a teacher's weekly prep, saving an estimated 3-4 hours. It ensures every lesson is aligned with NERDC standards and includes clear objectives, activities, classwork with solutions, and homework assignments.
**Hackathon Goal Alignment:** Fulfills the objective of “Generating lesson plans, teaching aids, and contextual examples for new and existing subjects”.



### Multilingual Translation
{/* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ien3urPyhsT83b1B-zAsAr5Wzmf9ys_C/view?usp=sharing */}
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ien3urPyhsT83b1B-zAsAr5Wzmf9ys_C/preview" 
  title="video player"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
>
</iframe>
* **What it does:** With a single click, teachers can translate any generated lesson plan from English into Hausa, Yoruba, or Igbo. The translation preserves formatting and adapts examples to be culturally appropriate.
* **How it helps:** This empowers teachers like Mrs. Amina to teach in their students' mother tongue, improving comprehension and classroom engagement. It removes language barriers and makes high-quality materials accessible to all.
* **Hackathon Goal Alignment:** Matches the requirement to ensure materials are “multilingual, and culturally relevant”.




### PDF Export for Offline Use
{/* https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VSwOab60sGg4ybVFSXq8CN_6AM7IOKm8/view?usp=sharing */}
